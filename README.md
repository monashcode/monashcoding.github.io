# MAC Sponsorship Site
------------------------
This repository is a simple site made for companies to sponsor in a more convenient manner via PayPal. 

There is an opportunity to use Stripe API later to improve this since PayPal requires a lot of formal authorisation that might be troublesome (another thing for the future!). 

Please be aware this is not the official site.
