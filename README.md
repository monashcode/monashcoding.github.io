# MAC Sponsorship Site

## What is this?
In response to credit card payments, this is a simple site made for companies to sponsor our club in a more convenient manner via PayPal. 

We made this basic site very quickly due to time constraints (company wanting to sponsor soon). Given more time, there is an opportunity to use Stripe API later to improve this (another thing for the future!). This is because PayPal requires a lot of formal authorisation that might be troublesome and we're not sure whether it will actually come through ☹️

Please be aware this is not the official site (may work as a placeholder site in the future though while we're waiting for our real site to be built).
